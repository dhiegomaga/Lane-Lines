Overview
---

This repo contains a proposed pipeline for detecting lane lines from video capture of vehicle frontal camera on road. It was tested on python 3.5, and is made available through jupyter notebook. 

Set Up and Testing
---
The python code uses the following libraries: __numpy, matplotlib, cv2, scipy.optimize, moviepy.editor and IPython.display. __

Experiments were carried on images and video. *test_images/* folder contains images for test, and the results are saved in *test_images_output/*. The videos are in *test_videos/*, and the output in *test_videos_output/*. 

In depth explanation of how it works can be found [here](https://github.com/dhiegomaga/Lane-Lines/blob/master/writeup.md).
